#forward propogation-
A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. As such, it is different from its descendant: recurrent neural networks. The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. 

#backward propogation-
Essentially, backpropagation evaluates the expression for the derivative of the cost function as a product of derivatives between each layer from left to right – "backwards" – with the gradient of the weights between each layer being a simple modification of the partial products (the "backwards propagated error").

#radial basis function-
A radial basis function (RBF) is a function that assigns a real value to each input from its domain (it is a real-value function), and the value produced by the RBF is always an absolute value; i.e. it is a measure of distance and cannot be negative. ... The radial basis functions act as activation functions.
